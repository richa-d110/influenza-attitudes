# Attitudes of Pittsburgh residents during 1918-19 flu outbreak

During the 1918 flu epidemic in the US, state public health agencies heavily relied on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) like mask-wearing, social distancing, and school closures to stop the spread of the disease. There are many resources documenting how people reacted to the disease as well as influenza case counts, specifically documented in the Influenza Archive linked here: https://www.influenzaarchive.org/.

Research question for now: How did Pittsburgh’s residents’ attitudes about the 1918-1919 flu outbreak and NPIs change as the epidemic progressed?
